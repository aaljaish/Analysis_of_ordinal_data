It processes   the data to compute win fractions, conducts a mixed model regression on these    win fractions, and fits a proportional odds model to analyze the relationship between the response variable and predictor groups within clusters.<br><br>

Ordinal_Cluster_Analysis Macro<br><br>
  
  This macro performs an ordinal cluster analysis on a given dataset. It processes the data to compute win fractions, conducts a mixed model regression on these 
  win fractions, and fits a proportional odds model to analyze the relationship between the response variable and predictor groups within clusters.<br><br>
  
  The macro executes the following main steps:<br><br>

    1. **Convert Data to Win Fractions**:
	   - Using code provided by Yu (2023)
       - Sorts the data by the specified grouping variable.
       - Calculates overall and within-group ranks based on the response variable.
       - Computes win fractions for each observation.
       - Displays the first 10 observations of the win fractions for verification.

    2. **Regression on Win Fractions Using Mixed Model**:
	   - Using code provided by Yu (2023)
       - Fits a mixed-effects model using the win fractions.
       - Includes random intercepts for each cluster to account for within-cluster correlation.
       - Outputs parameter estimates and calculates confidence intervals and p-values.

    3. **Visually assess proportional odds assumption using Empirical Logit Plot
       - The empirical logit plot is produced using EmpiricalLogitPlot macro provided by Derr (2013).

		    the SAS Global Forum 2013 Conference, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc.

    4. **Proportional Odds Model**:
       - Fits a cumulative logit model (proportional odds model) using `PROC GLIMMIX`.
       - Calculates and displays odds ratios and their cumulative probabilities.
  
  **Parameters:**<br>
    - `data=`       : **(Required)** Name of the input dataset.<br>
    - `y=`          : **(Required)** Name of the response variable (post-test score).<br>
    - `group=`      : **(Required)** Name of the grouping variable.<br>
    - `cluster_id=` : **(Required)** Identifier for clustering (e.g., subject ID).<br>

  
  **Usage Instructions:**<br>
  
    1. **Prepare Your Data**:
       - Ensure your dataset includes the response variable (`y`), grouping variable (`group`), and a cluster identifier (`cluster_id`).
    
    2. **Invoke the Macro**:
       - Call the macro with the appropriate parameters. For example:
         ```sas
         %Ordinal_Cluster_Analysis(
             data=study_data,
             y=post_test_score,
             group=intervention_group,
             cluster_id=subject_id
         );
         ```
    
    3. **Review the Outputs**:
       - **Win Fractions**: The macro prints the first 10 observations of the computed win fractions for a quick verification.
       - **Regression Results**: Parameter estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values are printed to assess the significance of the grouping variable.
       - **Proportional Odds Model**: Empirical logit plots are generated for assumption checking, and odds ratios with cumulative probabilities are displayed.
    
    4. **Interpret the Results**:
       - **Win Fractions**: Higher win fractions indicate better performance in the post-test relative to peers within the same group.
       - **Mixed Model Regression**: Evaluates the effect of the grouping variable on win fractions while accounting for cluster-level variability.
       - **Proportional Odds Model**: Assesses the association between the grouping variable and the ordinal response, providing odds ratios that reflect the likelihood of higher versus lower categories of the response variable.
  
  **Example Usage:**<br>
    Suppose you have a dataset `clinical_trial` with the following variables:<br>
      - `patient_id` : Unique identifier for each patient (cluster ID).<br>
      - `treatment`  : Treatment group indicator (e.g., 0 = Control, 1 = Treatment).<br>
      - `score`      : Post-treatment score (ordinal response).<br><br>
        
  **Notes:**<br>
    - Ensure that the response variable (`y`) is appropriately scaled and ordinal.<br>
    - The macro assumes that higher values of `y` indicate better outcomes. If lower values are of interest, consider modifying the `DESCENDING` option within the macro as needed.<br>
    - The macro includes internal plotting (`%EmpiricalLogitPlot`) for diagnostic checks.<br>
	  Ensure that the `EmpiricalLogitPlot` macro is available in your SAS environment.<br><br>
    
  **Dependencies:**<br>
    - `%EmpiricalLogitPlot` Macro: This macro is called within `Ordinal_Cluster_Analysis` for plotting empirical logits. The file `Analysis of Ordinal Data Macro.sas` has all the required dependencies for the macro to execute.<br><be>
