# Analysis_of_ordinal_data
This macro performs an ordinal cluster analysis on a given dataset. It processes   the data to compute win fractions, conducts a mixed model regression on these    win fractions, and fits a proportional odds model to analyze the relationship    between the response variable and predictor groups within clusters.
